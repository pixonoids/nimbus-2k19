F1D Flight Plane utilizes the elastic energy of rubber for free flight, with a flight timing of about 25-30 minutes depending upon the type and windings of rubber used. Although the structure seems incredibly simple, there is an immense amount of ingenuity and type of materials that go into its construction. We use lightweight balsa wood for frame construction of the plane and micro film for covering the wings. You will get a chance to make your very own indoor airplane and go head to head with other participants in a battle that will challenge your capabilities such as resource management, design skills, and aeronautical knowledge.</div>

After that they will proceed to second round. In this teams willmake the miniature form of canon gun of P.V.C pipe and will use projectiles for aiming.Once the gun isformed the participants will be given three chances to test their contraptions.

With the lid snapped on, the continuous creation of gas causes pressure tobuild up until the lid pops off, sending the rocket into the air.Like  all rocket  engines,  it  operates  on  the  principle  of   Newton's  third  law  of  motion.  Water  rockethobbyists typically use one or more plastic soft drink bottle as the rocket's pressure vessel.

After  that  the  cars  will  be  boosted  using  chemical  mixture  which  will  be triggered using the elastic material too. The speed of the car and the distance covered by it is directly proportional to the number of coils in the rubber band.
